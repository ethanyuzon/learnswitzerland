<h3><b><i>Geography</i></b></h3>
<h5>Switzerland lies in the heart of Europe. It shares its 1,935km-long border with five countries: Italy, France, Germany, Austria and the Principality of Liechtenstein.
Switzerland can be divided into three distinct geographical regions. The Alps cover roughly 58 percent of the country, the Central Plateau around 31 percent and the Jura 11 percent. It has 49 four-thousanders - mountain peaks that are 4,000 metres or higher. Although 70 percent of the national territory is mountainous, only a quarter of the population lives in those regions.<br>
Switzerland has around 1,500 lakes which, together with other bodies of water like streams and lakes, account for 4 percent of the country's surface area. The sources of four of Switzerland's main rivers - the Rhine, Rhone, Reuss and Ticino - are in the Gotthard massif, in the heart of the Swiss Alps.

<h2> Mountains </h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Swiss_Alps.jpg/1200px-Swiss_Alps.jpg" height= "500" width="700">
<h4><i>The Swiss Alps.</i></h4>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/North_face.jpg" height="500" width="700">
<h4><i>Eiger, one of the famous mountain peaks located at the Swiss Alps.</i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">The Swiss Alps are the highlight of any tour to Switzerland. Even though less than 15 percent of the Alps lie within Switzerland, it's the country that people most closely associate with the Alps. No doubt, Switzerland is home to some of the most famous Alpine locations - the Matterhorn, the Eiger, the Jungfrau - and many of the highest peaks and largest glaciers. It's also home to an extensive network of well-marked hiking trails. <br>
The Swiss Alps lie to the south of the Swiss Plateau. The geographic boundary between the Alps and the Plateau runs from Vevey on the shores of Lac Leman (Lake Geneva) to Rorschach on the shores of Lake Constance. The cities of Thun and Lucerne are on the southern fringe of the Swiss Plateau and are set against the Swiss Alps to the south.  The lower hills and mountains in Switzerland that lie in the foothills of the Alps are called the Swiss Prealps. <br>
Since before Roman times, the Swiss Alps have formed a natural barrier and division between northern and southern Europe. As such, they have played an important role in European history. At the same time, the mountain passes through the Swiss Alps have provided important trade routes connecting Italy with European countries to the north.</p>
<h2> Rivers </h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Middle_Bridge%2C_Basel%2C_Switzerland.JPG" height="500" width="700">
<h4><i>The Rhine River in Basel, Switzerland. </i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">With a length of 375 kilometers, the Rhine is the longest river in Switzerland. Although the Rhine flows far to the east of the country, thanks to mighty tributaries it drains 80 per cent of Switzerland's surface. Now it's time to leave the water for a short while, because at Neuhausen the mightily grown river plunges at the Rhine Falls into the depth. In the summer about 700 cubic meters of water gush downwards per second, the record quantity, however, is twice as high. The fearless climb under the Rhine Falls into one of the boats that travel very close to the roaring waters.<p>

<h4><i> Aare River seen from Bern, Switzerland. </i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">The Aare is the longest wholly Swiss river. It originates from the Oberaar glacier in the eastern Bernese Alps, flows through lakes Brienz and Thun, passes by the federal capital of Bern, is channelled into Lake Biel, follows the southern foot of the Jura range and finally flows into the Rhine at Koblenz, in north-western Switzerland. Passenger boats operate on the lakes as well as the river section from Biel to Solothurn.</p>

<h4><i>The Doubs River flowing through the peaceful village of Les Brenets, Switzerland. </i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">The Doubs River displays a variety of scenes, from picturesque gorges and raging torrents to romantic lakes and idyllic riverbanks that separate France and Switzerland. It is also a part of the Swiss-French border. A boat trip from Les Brenets to Maison Monsieur holds more surprises, including a visit to the underground mills at Col-des-Rochers, located near Le Locle.<p>
<h2> Lakes </h2>

<h4><i> Swiss Riviera of Lake Geneva in Montreux, Switzerland. </i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">Lake Geneva (or Lac Leman) is a crescent-shaped lake shared between France and Switzerland, and overlooked by the Alps. Lake Geneva is a water body of superlatives: mildest climate, largest lake and lake with the largest amount of water in Central Europe. The Celts called it Large Water or Lem an, and to this day it is called Lac Leman in French.</p>

<h4><i> Lake Neuchatel at the city of Neuchatel, Switzerland. </i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">The largest lake in Switzerland is a picture of a thousand colours, a recreational area and a waterway. It is the perfect place to relax and enjoy yourself. <br>
With its 220 km2, it can boast of being the largest lake entirely located on Swiss territory. Magnificent in good weather, fiery when the weather gets rough, it offers incredible spectacles in all seasons. And not content with being the largest, it also communicates with the lakes of Biel and Murten via the Thielle and Broye canals. This makes it possible to take beautiful cruises to discover the magical landscapes as you pass from one lake to the other.

<h4><i> A magnificent picturesque of the Lake Lucerne in Central Switzerland. </i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">Idyllic bays, fjord-like rock faces and deep blue water - Lake Lucerne is considered one of the most beautiful lakes in Switzerland.
Surrounded by majestic mountains, Lake Lucerne is the fourth largest lake in Switzerland. With its branching arms and bays, its shape is reminiscent of a fjord landscape. Its unusual shape was created at the end of the last ice age by the erosion of the Reuss glacier. Lake Lucerne owes its name to the four cantons bordering it, which were formerly called Waldstatten: Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Lucerne.</p>
<h2> Climate </h2>
<img src= "https://www.nordicvisitor.com/images/switzerland/first-cliff-walk-grindelwald-switzerland.jpg" height="500" width="700">
<h4><i> Summer climate in Switzerland. </i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">Summertime in Switzerland spans June through mid-September. At this time of year, attractions tend to have the longest opening hours. Plus, you'll have plenty of daylight, ideal for making the most of the spectacular views.
<br>
June is early summer and tends to be a little milder. Whereas July and August - peak summer season - are best for enjoying the year's warmest temperatures.

<h4><i> Winter season in Lucerne, Switzerland. </i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">Switzerland is beautiful all year round but in the winter, when the mountains turn totally white and there is a fresh crispiness to the air, the charm is only doubled.<br>
The lowest temperatures usually occur between December and February in all parts of Switzerland. At most measurement sites, January is generally the coldest month of the year. The greatest variability in temperature is found in winter.<br>
Wide slopes, deep snow, cool halfpipes, awesome cross-country ski trails, varied tobogganing runs and fabulous winter hiking trails - all within quick and easy reach. Switzerland is the ultimate winter paradise. Whether on a winter holiday, a weekend away or a day trip, fans of winter will be sure to find all they're looking for waiting for them in Switzerland.

<h4><i> The view of valley of Almagellerhorn above Saas-Fee in Autumn season at Valais, Switzerland. </i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">When the trees are covered in colourful leaves, wine festivals are taking place, and seasonal specialties such as pumpkin and chestnuts appear on your table, that's when we know that autumn has arrived. Hiking is particularly enjoyable at this time too. Mild temperatures and the view across the fog attract hikers to the mountains.<br>
Autumn season in Switzerland is from September to November. If you want fall colors, the best time to visit is mid October. If you want the most hiking options, best to come in September before mountain resort close.
