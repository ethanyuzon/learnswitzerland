<h3><b><i>Culture and Traditions</i></b></h3>
<h5>Switzerland is a country with immense cultural diversity and living heritage. Its geographical position between several countries, such as Germany, Italy, France, Austria, and Liechtenstein has influenced this cultural diversity, not to mention the influence the 26 cantons have in the Swiss culture.
<br>
However, its location and canton division arenâ€™t the only factors that influence the culture in Switzerland. Some of the things that characterize Switzerland, such as arts, clothing, cuisine, and many more, are influenced by events that happened way before the country was established. That is why we have decided to go back in time.</h5>
<h2> History </h2>

<h4><i>The Swiss Confederation to 1798.</i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">Since 1848, the Swiss Confederation has been a federal republic of relatively autonomous cantons, some of which have a history of federation that goes back more than 700 years, putting them among the world's oldest surviving republics.
<br>
<br>
The early history of the region is tied to that of Alpine culture. Switzerland was inhabited by the Helvetii, and it came under Roman rule in the 1st century BC. The Gallo-Roman culture was amalgamated with Germanic influence during late antiquity, with the eastern part of Switzerland becoming Alemannic territory. The area of Switzerland was incorporated into the Frankish Empire in the 6th century. In the High Middle Ages, the eastern German-speaking part belonged to the Duchy of Swabia within the Holy Roman Empire, while the western French-speaking part was part of Burgundy.
<br>
<br>
The Old Swiss Confederacy in the Late Middle Ages (the Eight Cantons) established its independence from the House of Habsburg and the Duchy of Burgundy, and in the Italian Wars gained territory south of the Alps from the Duchy of Milan. The Swiss Reformation divided the Confederacy and resulted in a drawn-out history of internal strife between the Thirteen Cantons in the Early Modern period. In the wake of the French Revolution, Switzerland fell to a French invasion in 1798 and was reformed into the Helvetic Republic, a French client state. Napoleon's Act of Mediation in 1803 restored the status of Switzerland as a confederation, and after the end of the Napoleonic period, the Swiss Confederation underwent a period of turmoil culminating in a brief civil war in 1847 and the creation of a federal constitution in 1848.</p>

<h4><i>The federal troops during the Sonderbund war.</i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">The history of Switzerland since 1848 has been largely one of success and prosperity. Industrialisation transformed the traditional agricultural economy, and Swiss neutrality during the World Wars and the success of the banking industry furthered the ascent of Switzerland to its status as one of the world's most stable economies.
<br>
<br>
Switzerland signed a free-trade agreement with the European Economic Community in 1972 and has participated in the process of European integration by way of bilateral treaties, but it has notably resisted accession to the European Union (EU) even though its territory almost completely (except for the microstate Liechtenstein) has been surrounded by EU member states since 1995. In 2002, Switzerland joined the United Nations.</p>
<h2> Language </h2>
<img src="https://i.redd.it/ibdit86cp2r41.jpg" height="500" width="700">
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">German is the primary language for more than 60% of the population, although in practice, Swiss German, a collection of Alemannic dialects, is the predominant spoken form. French is the main language in the French-speaking region of Switzerland, known as Romandie in French.
<br>
<br>
The four national languages of Switzerland are German, French, Italian, and Romansh. German, French, and Italian maintain equal status as official languages at the national level within the federal administration of the Swiss Confederation, while Romansh is used in dealings with people who speak it. Latin is occasionally used in some formal contexts, particularly to denote the country (Confoederatio Helvetica).<p>

<h4><i>Fasnacht Festival.</i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">Fasnacht Basel is the largest and most famous carnival in Switzerland. Breaking from tradition, Basel carnival is on the Monday following Ash Wednesday, occurring over the locally-coined three finest days. Basel Fasnachtlers dress head to toe in costumes to completely hide their identities. Members of cliques - bands playing piccolos and basler drums - wear themed garbs to parade around Basel Fasnacht.<p>

<h4><i>The Swiss sport farmers' golf or more known as Hornussen.</i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">The game received its name from the key element - a puck called hornuss or nouss. The goal is to hit the hornuss as far as you can to your opponents' side and you only score when nobody of the rival team members hinders the shot with catchboards. Usually the teams play two turns, hitting once and defending once each turn. The game normally lasts 3-4 hours and the excitement only gets stronger every time the nousse crosses the air. As a player, you should really have a sharp eye and a quick response to notice it flying towards you - the Hornuss can speed up to 306 km/h and its flight length can reach 330 meters! The team with the largest number of hornusses stopped wins the game of Hornussen.<p>

<h4><i>Switzerland's national sport, Schwingen, which is the Swiss form of wrestling.</i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">Schwingen (from German schwingen to swing), also known as Swiss wrestling (French lutte Suisse) and natively (and colloquially) as Hosenlupf (Swiss German for breeches-lifting), is a style of folk wrestling native to Switzerland, more specifically the pre-alpine parts of German-speaking Switzerland. Wrestlers wear Schwingerhosen (wrestling breeches) with belts that are used for taking holds. Throws and trips are common because the first person to pin his or her opponent's shoulders to the ground wins the bout.<p>
