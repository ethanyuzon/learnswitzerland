<h3><b><i>Culture and Traditions</i></b></h3>
<h5>Switzerland is a country with immense cultural diversity and living heritage. Its geographical position between several countries, such as Germany, Italy, France, Austria, and Liechtenstein has influenced this cultural diversity, not to mention the influence the 26 cantons have in the Swiss culture.
<br>
However, its location and canton division arenâ€™t the only factors that influence the culture in Switzerland. Some of the things that characterize Switzerland, such as arts, clothing, cuisine, and many more, are influenced by events that happened way before the country was established. That is why we have decided to go back in time.</h5>
<h2> History </h2>

<h4><i>The Swiss Confederation to 1798.</i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">Since 1848, the Swiss Confederation has been a federal republic of relatively autonomous cantons, some of which have a history of federation that goes back more than 700 years, putting them among the world's oldest surviving republics.
<br>
<br>
The early history of the region is tied to that of Alpine culture. Switzerland was inhabited by the Helvetii, and it came under Roman rule in the 1st century BC. The Gallo-Roman culture was amalgamated with Germanic influence during late antiquity, with the eastern part of Switzerland becoming Alemannic territory. The area of Switzerland was incorporated into the Frankish Empire in the 6th century. In the High Middle Ages, the eastern German-speaking part belonged to the Duchy of Swabia within the Holy Roman Empire, while the western French-speaking part was part of Burgundy.
<br>
<br>
The Old Swiss Confederacy in the Late Middle Ages (the Eight Cantons) established its independence from the House of Habsburg and the Duchy of Burgundy, and in the Italian Wars gained territory south of the Alps from the Duchy of Milan. The Swiss Reformation divided the Confederacy and resulted in a drawn-out history of internal strife between the Thirteen Cantons in the Early Modern period. In the wake of the French Revolution, Switzerland fell to a French invasion in 1798 and was reformed into the Helvetic Republic, a French client state. Napoleon's Act of Mediation in 1803 restored the status of Switzerland as a confederation, and after the end of the Napoleonic period, the Swiss Confederation underwent a period of turmoil culminating in a brief civil war in 1847 and the creation of a federal constitution in 1848.</p>

<h4><i>The federal troops during the Sonderbund war.</i></h4>
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">The history of Switzerland since 1848 has been largely one of success and prosperity. Industrialisation transformed the traditional agricultural economy, and Swiss neutrality during the World Wars and the success of the banking industry furthered the ascent of Switzerland to its status as one of the world's most stable economies.
<br>
<br>
Switzerland signed a free-trade agreement with the European Economic Community in 1972 and has participated in the process of European integration by way of bilateral treaties, but it has notably resisted accession to the European Union (EU) even though its territory almost completely (except for the microstate Liechtenstein) has been surrounded by EU member states since 1995. In 2002, Switzerland joined the United Nations.</p>
<h2> Lake Geneva </h2>

<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">Lake Geneva is a water body of superlatives: mildest climate, largest lake and lake with the largest amount of water in Central Europe. The Celts called it Large Water or Lem an, and to this day it is called Lac Leman in French. And it certainly is big.<p>
<h2> Rhine Falls </h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/SBB_RABe_514_DTZ_Rheinfall.jpg" height="500" width="700">
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">The Rhine Falls (Rheinfall) is breathtaking stupendous beauty and the largest plain waterfall in Europe. The falls are located on the High Rhine at Neuhausen am Rheinfall Village and just below Schaffhausen in the north of Switzerland. The Rhine's waters flow at the rate of 23 meters over a breadth of 150 meters.<p>
<h2> Jungfrau </h2>
<img src="https://holidaystoswitzerland.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jungfrau_Travel_Pass.jpg" height="500" width="700">
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">Jungfrau is one of the most famous peaks in the Swiss Alps, standing at 4,158 meters (13,642 feet) in the Bernese Oberland region of Switzerland. It is part of a trio of iconic mountains, along with the Eiger and Monch. The region is known for its breathtaking scenery, dramatic glaciers, and alpine landscapes.<p>
<h2> Bern </h2>
<img src="https://travelsquire.com/ts/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TS-Bern-Old-Town-from-above-copyright-Bern-Tourism-scaled-e1617150624122.jpg" height="500" width="700">
<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 30px;">Bern, the capital city of Switzerland, is built around a crook in the Aare River. It traces its origins back to the 12th century, with medieval architecture preserved in the Altstadt (Old Town). The Swiss Parliament and diplomats meet in the Neo-Renaissance Bundeshaus (Federal Palace). The Franzosische Kirche (French Church) and the nearby medieval tower known as the Zytglogge both date to the 13th century.</p>
